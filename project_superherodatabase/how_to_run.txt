-- locally
cd into the project directory and run the command "python app.py" on the command line. Flask gives
us an option of testing locally. I am running the local webserver on port 5000. Go to localhost:5000 
to access the application.


-- heroku (continous integration and deployment)
The application has also been deployed on heroku.com at the url  http://superherodatabase.herokuapp.com/
Details on the installation can be found here : 

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python
steps: 

1. install heroku toolbelt and create heroku account

2. heroku create (this step creates a remote git repository from the contents of the folder)
** steps 1 and 2 are done only once
** Procfile tells heroku the file to run to start the app and the webserver to use
requirements.txt has dependencies heroku needs to install while deploying the app (Flask,pyscopg2,gunicorn and other packages etc..)

3. perform git push heroku master

4. heroku ps:scale web=1 (run a unit dyno). we can check status of the web app by heroku ps command.
* heroku logs to check if something went wrong
* database server instance needs to be started. the address of the database server instance 
is used in the config.py file to intialize the db_session variable.
